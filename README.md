The purpose of this project is to use classification to predict the operating condition of a waterpoint for each record in the dataset. 

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, we will predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all. 

Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. 

A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
